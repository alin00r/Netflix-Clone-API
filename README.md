## Setting Up Your Local Environment

Follow these steps to set up your local environment for the Netflix-API:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alin00r/Netflix-API.git

   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Before you can run the Netflix-API, you need to set up your environment variables. These variables store sensitive information required for the app to function properly. Follow these steps to configure your environment variables:

   1. **Create a `.env` File:**
      In the root directory of the app, create a file named `.env`.

   2. **Add the Following Environment Variables:**
      Replace the placeholders with your actual information. You might need to sign up for accounts and services to obtain the required credentials.

      ```dotenv

      # MongoDB Configuration
      DATABASE_URI=your-mongodb-database-url


      # JSON Web Token Configuration
      SECRET=your-json-web-token-secret

      ```

# API reference

During API development, I use `Postman` for handling/testing all endpoints.

- Postman collection/documentation is available on this link [click here](#)
- Base URL endpoints: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/V1/` or `http://localhost:PORT/api/v1/`
